# Rechiseled Bookshelves

This is a Minecraft mod for *Fabric/Quilt 1.19.3 (22w42a)* which makes **Chiseled Bookshelf** better.

## Features

- **Chiseled Bookshelf** now can be used to upgrade enchantment levels of **Enchanting Tables** based on the items it stored. When the bookshelf stored ≧3 of any items, or ≧1 of any enchanted books, the chiseled bookshelf will upgrade the enchantment level just like what typical bookshelf does.
- Now not only air, but also **fluids** and **no-bounding-box blocks** can be seen as allowed blocks between **Enchanting Tables** and bookshelves.
